# info523-final-project

### Summary of presentation:
In this presentation I'll briefly explore the history of topic modeling, 
cover the top level functionality of BERTopic,
and then demonstrate how we can use BERTopic and topic modeling to tackle 
the real world issue of reviewing our training data for human bias and any other potential anomalies.
Specifically, I utilize BERTopic to investigate what topics are present within the english sentences in Tatoeba's English/Spanish bitext corpus.
